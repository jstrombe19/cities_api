  #this is a custom validation, which you will rarely need for the scope of your apps while in the program
  #however, it is good to know this is available to you
  
  ### before_save :greater_than_zero ###
  
  # also, there are validations that are pre-defined for nearly any case you may come up against
  # this example of a custom validation from me was redundant, because Rails already has one defined, shown
  # below under the name and state presence validations

  #standard validation syntax: validates :#{attribute}, #{validation (presence, length, etc)}: #{value testing against}
  validates :name, :state, presence: true
  validates :crimes_per_capita, numericality: {greater_than: 0}

  # using pre-defined validations will allow you to avoid having to manually define errors that should accompany
  # the validations

  # you CAN define custom validations here, though most use cases you will run up against will be accounted
  # for and pre-defined for you to simply use out of the box -- RAILS!!!!

  # def greater_than_zero
  #   if self[:crimes_per_capita] < 0
  #     throw abort
